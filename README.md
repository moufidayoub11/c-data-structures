# Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C programming language. Each data structure is implemented as a separate module and stored in its own sub-folder within this repository.

## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to provide well-documented and efficient implementations of fundamental data structures commonly used in computer science and software development. Understanding and implementing these data structures is crucial for any programmer to build efficient algorithms and solve complex problems.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on setting up the project locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To work with this repository, you'll need the following tools installed on your system:

- Git
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Any text editor for C programming (e.g., nano, vim, emacs)

### Installing
